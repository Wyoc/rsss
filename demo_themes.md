## Usage

The improved UI automatically applies when running the TUI mode:

```bash
# Build the enhanced version
make build

# Run in TUI mode to see improvements
make run-tui

# Or run directly
./build/rsss --menu
```

### üìÅ **File Structure**
The notification system creates these files in `~/.config/rsss/`:
- `config.json` - Application settings including notification preferences
- `feeds.json` - Your RSS feed subscriptions  
- `seen.json` - Tracks which articles you've already seen

### üîî **How Notifications Work**
1. **First Run**: All current articles are marked as "seen" without notification
2. **Subsequent Runs**: New articles trigger both system and in-app notifications
3. **System Notifications**: Appears in your desktop notification center (Linux with `notify-send`)
4. **In-App Notifications**: Shows a banner within the TUI interface
5. **Persistence**: Article tracking survives app restarts
6. **Smart Refresh**: Only shows notifications for truly new content
7. **Requirements**: On Linux, ensure `libnotify` is installed (`pacman -S libnotify` on Arch)

All existing functionality remains the same, but with a much more polished interface and intelligent new article notifications!
